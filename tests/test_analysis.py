# Generated build artifacts. Never commit these: they're fully
# regenerable from cell-count.csv + the code (make pipeline / app.py's
# self-init both rebuild cell_counts.db from scratch), and a committed
# derived file can silently drift out of sync with the source CSV or
# code if either changes without someone remembering to regenerate and
# re-commit it. If any of these already exist in the repo's git history,
# run `git rm --cached <file>` once to actually untrack them. Adding a
# .gitignore entry alone does not retroactively remove a tracked file.
